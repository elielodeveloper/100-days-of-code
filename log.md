# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 06, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I´ve just fineshed the "Basic HTML and HTML5" of Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours).

**Thoughts:** To study Basic HTML and HTML5 was a kind of revision, but it is always a good thing to remember and keeping in mind the basics.

### Day 2: November 07, 2018

**Today´s Progress**:Today I´ve studied The CSS Basics. Actually, it was kinda surprising to figure out how many things is possible to do with it.

**Thoughts:** The new topic that I had learned today was the CSS variables, CSS browser fallbacks and of course the penguin example from freeCodeCamp.

### Day 3: November 08, 2018

**Today´s Progress**:Today I´d just dived into the applied visual design subsection from responsive web design course at freecodecamp.

**Thoughts:** In my opinion, one of the most important things is to clearly understand the CSS Box Model. Actually, learning this section still in progress.
