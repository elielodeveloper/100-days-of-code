# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 06, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today IÂ´ve just fineshed the "Basic HTML and HTML5" of Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours).

**Thoughts:** To study Basic HTML and HTML5 was a kind of revision, but it is always a good thing to remember and keeping in mind the basics.

### Day 2: November 07, 2018

**TodayÂ´s Progress**:Today IÂ´ve studied The CSS Basics. Actually, it was kinda surprising to figure out how many things is possible to do with it.

**Thoughts:** The new topic that I had learned today was the CSS variables, CSS browser fallbacks and of course the penguin example from freeCodeCamp.

### Day 3: November 08, 2018

**TodayÂ´s Progress**:Today IÂ´d just dived into the applied visual design subsection from responsive web design course at freecodecamp.

**Thoughts:** In my opinion, one of the most important things is to clearly understand the CSS Box Model. Actually, learning this section still in progress.

### Day 4: November 12, 2018

**TodayÂ´s Progress**:Today IÂ´ve learned more about "Applied Visual Design" from FreeCodeCampÂ´s course.

**Thoughts:** In my opinion, there were three important topics:
Use the CSS Transform scale Property to Scale an Element on Hover
Use the CSS Transform Property skewX to Skew an Element Along the X-Axis and Y-Axis
Use the Z-index

With the aim of getting more practice, IÂ´ve just dived into drawing pure CSS images.

### Day 5: November 13, 2018

**TodayÂ´s Progress**:Today IÂ´ve finally finished the "Applied Visual Design" module, and I just get started with "Applied Accessibility". From responsive web design course at freecodecamp.

**Thoughts:** In my opinion, today was kinda hard, because dealing with CSS transition is a new topic. I just need to practice more.

### Day 1: November 14, 2018 [Reboot]

**TodayÂ´s Progress**:According to the rules IÂ´ve missed two days in a row, so IÂ´d just restarted the count ðŸ˜œ. Today IÂ´ve done with "Applied Accessibility" module from @freeCodeCamp. Also, I tried to draw a pikachu using Pure CSS.

**Thoughts:** In my opinion, the most important subject of today was how to build a page accessible for people that need special care. Like how to set contrast for color blind people.

### Day 2: November 15, 2018

**TodayÂ´s Progress**:Today IÂ´ve done with "Responsible Web Design Principles" and "CSS flexbox" modules from @freeCodeCamp. Also, I tried to draw some Pure CSS pic but I didn't well succeed..

**Thoughts:** Need to revise the Responsible Web Design Principles. It seems to be really important

### Day 3: November 16, 2018

**TodayÂ´s Progress**: Today I've done the "CSS flexbox" module and get the started with "CSS grid" from @freeCodeCamp. Also, I just had restarted a React course from Udemy made by @ste_grider !!!

**Thoughts:** ...

### Day 4: November 17, 2018

**TodayÂ´s Progress**: Today I've done the "CSS Grid"Module from @freeCodeCamp !!! Actually, I'm feeling really excited 'cause I'm near to get my first freeCodeCamp certification!!!ðŸ¤—  Also I've done some progress at React course from Udemy

**Thoughts:** ...

### Day 5: November 18, 2018

**TodayÂ´s Progress**: Although I've gotten some progress studying React at udemy's course I've struggled with freecodecamp "responsive web design projects".

**Thoughts:** Maybe it will be good to revise some fundamentals.
